## Explaination

Binary search is a

- log(n) speed
- search algorithm
- that works on a sorted list.

Think about searching thru a large decks of sorted cards containing random numbers.
Is unlikely that you will look at card from start to end.
The most logical way will be to repeated look at the middle card.

- If middle card value is lower than the value you are searching for.
- you will now look at the upper deck.
- If not you will look at the lower dec.
